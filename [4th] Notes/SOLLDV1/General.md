//Key Learning Points: often appears in examinations

1. Exploring DevOps

1. Set of practices/tools/cultural philosophies.
2. DevOps Handbook definition, in summary, it is about collaboration
3. DevOps is evolving through emerging practices that are delivering real value in real organizations.
4. DevOps was established to help improve efficiency. Mas effective kapag nag setup ng cross-functional teams, ung isang role pwede lumipat temporarily sa ibang role.
5. Effectively integrates other frameworks.
6. Critical ang pag gamit ng tools sa DevOps
7. End-to-end delivery focus, from building to delivering to the client.
8. This can be applied to legacy (luma) na enterprises. Hindi totoo ang DevOps is only applicable to UNICORN “Startups”
9. It focuses on feedback loops and continuous improvement.
10. If an organization wants to integrate DevOps, it needs cultural change.
11. DevOps is evolving through a shared and Collective Body of Knowledge (CBoK) including:

1. Publications
2. Conferences
3. MeetUp Groups
4. Slack Channels
5. LinkedIn Groups
6. Videos and Webinars
7. Blogs, articles, podcasts
8. Case studies
9. Awards
10. Subject matter experts, and AI

12. DevOps Revolution

![](image12.png)

11. 1970s-1980s: Mainframes Era; ito ng DevOps (Origin?)

- Very costly ($1M - $100M) and very slow cycle time (1-5 years)
- Cost of Failure: bankruptcy, sell the company, massive layoffs.

12. 1990s: Client/Server Era

- Cost ($100k - $10M) and 3-12 months cycle time
- Cost of Failure: revenue miss, CIO’s job

13. 2000s-Present: Commoditization and Cloud

- Cost ($10k-$1m) and 2-12 weeks cycle time
- Cost of failure: Negligible

13. What DevOps is NOT

1. A title
2. A separate team
3. A tool
4. Only culture
5. Only automation
6. Anarchy
7. A one size fits all strategy

14. Why DevOps is important now?

To meet these changing conditions, IT must adapt its culture, practices and technologies to be more continuous.

8. Agility: Time to value must accelerate
9. Efficiency: Increasing complex applications and infrastructure
10. Stability: Need stable, reliable services with fast response to issues
11. Quality: Customers choose the best quality services
12. Security: Modern distributed systems need protections
13. Team Satisfaction: Hiring and retaining talent is critical

15. What makes DevOps so unique?
16. DevOps applies systems thinking across the end-to-end value stream

![](SOLLDV1/Img/image5.png)

14. End-to-end, mula sa pag build hanggang may bumili nung product.
15. Value stream “Flow of Work”: Identify the “wastes” here to improve the flow of value..
16. Systems Thinking: A Holistic approach to analysis that focuses on how different systems interact and how they influence one another.
17. Nine Pillars of Continuous Practices:

- Leadership 
- Culture: having shared goals and objectives; collaboration
- Design: loosely coupled or tightly architecture (difficult to change due to dependencies)
- Continuous integration/testing/delivery
- Elastic Infrastructure: dynamically (no need to shutdown the system) reallocate and allocate resources
- Continuous Monitoring: checking the health of the infrastructure.
- Continuous Security: Ensure security checks are done early. Hindi lang sa huli ichecheck.

![](SOLLDV1/Img/image11.png)

All of these are required for end-to-end value stream

![](SOLLDV1/Img/image2.png)

CALMS. All of these are required to understand and remember.

![](SOLLDV1/Img/image7.png)

![](SOLLDV1/Img/image10.png)

- Stakeholders are anyone who is affected by the product.

//Collaboration: Working together to achieve a shared goal or objective.

//Cooperation: Kanya-kanya ung task pero aligned in goals; tasks are set individually para once mafail ung task ay its on you lang.

//Commoditized: parang inuutilize na ung new advancements (AWS).

//Lean Framework: visualizes the flow of work so that we would know which of those tasks are valuable or non valuable; identify bottlenecks or idle capacity “wastes” then these will be reduced.

//ITIL: provides release and deployment (change development)??

//Silos: Lalagyanan ng mga grains o bigas; the purpose of this to avoid outside air para hindi masira ung bigas. In DevOps, kapag may tao na hindi nag shashare ng information sa buong group dahil individual grading reasons, mag cacause to ng significantly affect the success.  
//Mahirap i-encapsulate ang DevOps sa isang body of knowledge kaya may CBoK.

DevOps Myths

- DevOps is ONLY for Startups
- DevOps replaces Agile

- It is not intended to replace Agile or any framework.
- Ang DevOps is to integrate one or more frameworks.
- Agile is effective enabler of DevOps

- DevOps is Incompatible with ITIL
- DevOps means eliminating IT operations, or “NoOps”
- DevOps is just “Inafrastructure as Code” or Automation
- DevOps is only for Open-source software

//Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL): a framework with a set of practices for IT activities; provides end-to-end management services (e.g. kapag live na ung production, ung mga services katulad ng mga customer service). For example, ticketing system (CONCiERGE ng DLSU).

//L.A.C.K Stack: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP

Why does DevOps matter?

- Our cadence is off

- Previously, it is like ( [Business] innovation -> [Development] waterfall projects -> [IT Operations] rigorous processes)

- DevOps improves IT’s cadence and velocity

- Agile, Lean, and ITSM practices are also needed.
- [Business] Winning through innovation -> [Agile, Lean, DevOps] Continuous delivery

- DevOps improves throughput and stability

//Cadence: the flow or rhythm of events

The business perspective

- Why the ubsines id driving DevOps?

- Faster time-to-market
- Enchanced customer satisfaction
- Increased business agility
- Cost efficiency
- Improved risk management
- Better collaboration and communication
- Enhanced innovation

// Flexible infrastructure is a predictor of team performance, organizational performance, operational performance, and software delivery performance. Cloud computing is a core enabler of flexible infrastructure.

// People don't buy what you do, but people buy why you do it. (Listen on YouTube to Start with ‘why’ - TED Talk from Simon Sinek)

The IT perspective

- Why IT is driving DevOps

- Automation of repetitive tasks
- CI/CD
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Monitoring and logging
- Scalability and flexibility
- Improved collaboration and communication
- Version control and configuration management
- Resilience and recovery
- Enhanced testing practices
- Containerization and microservices

// These technical drivers underpin the DevOps approach, enabling IT teams to deliver software more efficiently, reliably, and with higher quality.

- The IT Challenge

- DevOps must continuously deliver outcomes by bridging and improving almost every aspect of IT

- Internal IT challenges:

- IT must go faster, faster, faster without risking quality
- Prior investments are not delivering end-to-end value

- Agile SW development is good but is not delivering full value
- ITSM processes are good but are not delivering full value
- New automation is good but is not delivering ful value

- IT’s silo culture is constraining the value stream

// IT no longer needs to align or integrate with the business, IT is the business.

- The wall of confusion

- Disconnection between Devs and Operations activities. Devs want to introduce new features, but Ops wants to prioritize stability first. This creates a “downward spiral,” which increases outages and technical debt (backlogs).
- ![](SOLLDV1/Img/image1.png)

- Speed, cost, quality (Higher Traingle), in DevOps dapat present lahat.

- IT’s silo culture

- Isolated IT silos can foster stereotypes and misconceptions between Dev, Ops and other IT teams
- It can also affect the flow of work and IT’s ability to deliver innovation continuously.
- May kanya-kanyang specialization. For devs, gusto mag trabaho lang mag isa kaya hindi na kailangan makipag usap. For QA, gusto lahat functional lahat.

The Three Ways

![](SOLLDV1/Img/image4.png)

- Flow: Ang iniimprove: requirement design -> building -> integration -> testing -> deployment then eventually the release. “Left to Right”

- Goal: to have workflow quickly from left to right; to move quickly and have a fast flow.

- We can improve the workflow by increasing the deployment and release frequency.

- Understanding the flow of work
- Increasing flow by understanding and removing constraints
- Never passing a known defect downstream
- Never allowing local optimization to cause global degradation
- Achieving a profound understanding of the entire system![](SOLLDV1/Img/image8.png)

![](SOLLDV1/Img/image9.png)

- Explot the constraint? Let’s just reduce. Optimize what you have.
- Subordinate & Synchronize to the Constraint? There’s no point in improving the first two steps if you havent remove the limiting factor. Subordinate? Adjust to the constraint or improve for the constraint.

- Common constraints:

- Development delays
- Environment creating (test, staging, production, and so forth)
- Code deployment
- Test setup and run
- Security or QA assessments
- Overly tight architecture
- Product management
- Complex or bureaucratic processes

- Feedback: short feedback loops “Right to left”

- Goal? To shorten and amplify right to left feedback loops so necessary corrections can be continually made.
- Understand and respond to the needs of all customers, both internal and external
- Shorten and amplify all feedback loops
- Create and embed knowledge where needed
- Enables the creation of a generative high-trust culture.
- Shortening and amplifying feedback loops creates safer systems.
- With shorter feedback loops:

- Sharing and knowledge grow
- Trust grows
- We better understand our customers, both internal and external
- We fix defects faster and are better able to prevent problems
- Processes are improved resulting in better flow, faster delivery speeds and less reactive, unplanned work.

// Shared goals, shared pains

// Kailangan pa bumalik sa previous step kapag may naidentify na error kaya maganda kapag nadedetect agad early on kaysa sa dulo pa siya makita.

// Automated Testing: (1) validation, ito ay nasa requirements palang (2) testin

- Continuous experimentation and learning

- Encourages a culture that foster two things:

- Continual experimentation, taking risks, and learning from failure
- Understanding that repetition and practice are the prerequisites to mastery.

- Allocate time for the improvement of daily work
- Create rituals that reward the team for taking risks
- Introduce faults into the system to increase resilience.
- Encourage a learning culture

- Encourage daily learning and knowledge sharing
- Create training and skills-based education plans
- Incorporate learning into processes
- Use technology to accelerate learning
- Make work educational through experimentation, problem solving, and demonstrations
- Allow and use mistakes as sources of learning
- Make the results of learning visible

Chaos Engineering

- The “Simian Army” concept was first adopted by Netflix as a service that randomly terminates a production instance.
- Response to attacks helps to build competencies to recover the production environment from inevitable failures.

Business and Technology Frameworks

- Business and Technology Frameworks

- Agile, ITSM (IT Service Management) / ITIL, LEAN, VSM (Value Stream Mapping), SRE (Site Reliability Engineering), Safety culture, Learning organizations, Continuous funding

- DevOps cannot stand alone

- Successful DevOps relies on the adoption and integration of multiple frameworks and methodologies

- Agile

- May “Feedback” every iteration/sprint (2nd way)
- The Agile Manifesto

- The underlying concepts of Agile software development were first laid out in the Agile Manifesto.

- It is more important to be agile than do agile: (Principles or values of Agile)

- Be customer-centric
- Be lean
- Be collaborative
- Be communicative
- Be adaptive
- Be measurable
- Be consistent
- Be results-oriented
- Be reflective

- We value:

- Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools
- Working software over Comprehensive documetation
- Customer collaboration over Contract negotiations
- Responding to change over Following a plan

- Scrum

- Scrum is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex projects. Scrum provides a small set of rules that create ‘just enough’ structure or teams to be able to focus their innovation on solving what might otherwise be an insurmountable challenge.
- The most commonly applied Agile software development practice
- Deceptively simple yet difficult to master
- Not a process or a technique for building products. (This only manages the team)
- Roles:

- Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team

- Artifacts:

- Product backlog, Sprint backlog, Increment

- Product Backlog:

- Stories (User Stories): short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end-user.
- Epics: are large bodies of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks called stories
- Initiatives: collections of epics that drive toward a common goal
- Themes: large focus areas that span the organization

- Meetings:

- The sprint, sprint review, sprint planning, sprint retrospective, daily scrum

- Challenges for large organizations:

- Cultural and organizational resistance
- Coordination across multiple teams
- Maintaining consistency and alignment
- Integration with legacy systems
- Resource allocation and management
- Communication and collaboration
- Measuring performance and success
- Budgeting and financial planning
- Governance and compliance
- Tooling and infrastructure
- Gathering system requirements
- Executing releases across multiple teams

- Solutions for large organizations

- Use project management tools to synchronize backlogs, sprints, and releases.
- Have clear organizational goals and regular alignment meetings
- Modernize legacy systems and create integration layers
- Invest in training programmes
- Introduce collaboration tools and communication protocols
- Use metrics and dashboards to track cross-team outcomes
- Update budgeting practices for iterative financial planning
- Establish governance for decentralized compliance.
- Standardize tools for CI/CD and integration needs
- Engage stakeholders early and continuously refine requirements
- Coordinate release planning and continuous integration activities
- Work to break dependencies rather than managing complexity.

- Increasing Agility

- DevOps increases agility by:

- Breaking down silos
- Reducing constraints
- Taking a unified approach to systems engineering
- Applying Agile principles to both Dev and Ops
- Sharing knowledge, skills, experience, and data
- Recognizing and criticality of automation
- Deploying faster with fewer errors

- IT Service Management (ITSM)

- ITIL “IT Infrastructure Library”

- Widely recognized framework on IT service management
- ITIL 4: defines a service as a means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.

- Consists of two key components: (1) Four Dimensions Model (2) Service Value System
- Four Dimensions Model:

- Value streams and processes
- Organizations and people
- Information and technology
- Partners and suppliers

- Service Value Stream

- Guiding principles
- Governance
- Service Value Chin
- Practices
- Continual Improvement

- Ung service value system needs ung four dimension model.

- There 34 practices in ITIL

- Service Management: end-to-end
- Provides guidance and structure to processes such as change, configuration, release, incident and problem management
- DevOps needs ITSM practices to meet the goal of deploying faster changes without causing destruction.
- Agile Service Management

- Ensures that ITSM processes reflect Agile values and are designed with ‘just enough’ control and structure in order to effectively and efficiently deliver services that facilitate customer outcomes when and how they are needed.
- Adapts Agile practices to ITSM process design
- Implements service management in small, integrated increments
- Ensures ITSM processes reflect Agile values from initial design through CI
- Encourages ‘minimum viable’ and ‘just enough’ processes to increases speed and conformance.
- Agile Service Management does not reinvent ITSM; it modernizes the approach.

- LEAN

- Originate sa Manufacturing
- Toyota are the pioneers of LEAN.
- Lean Perspectives:

- DevOps has its roots in the Lean manufacturing world, which addresses the problem of engineers designing products that factories cannot afford to build.
- Lean IT applies the key ideas behind Lean production to the development and management of IT products and services.

- Bakit nag lelean?: to improve the flow of work and reduce wastes (non value adding activities)
- Goal?: The goal of Lean thinking is to create more value for customers with fewer resources and less waste. Waste is any activity that does not add value to the process.

- May table pa to kung saan nag shoshow columns: source, purpose, and examples.

- Value Stream Mapping (VSM)

- Value Stream Mapping is a Lean tool that depicts the flow of information, materials and work across functional silos with an emphasis on quantifying waste, including time and quality.
- Value stream: the sequence of activities required to design, produce, and deliver a specific product or service
- Value stream mapping enables cross-functional teams to:

- See an entire value stream from a work and information flow perspective
- Identify areas of non-value waste that could be eliminated in an effort to improve flow and deliver greater value
- Identify, prioritize and measure improvements.

- Kata: any structured way of thinking and acting that you practice until the pattern becomes a habit.

- Uses Plan-Do-Check-Act

- Plan: understand long-term vision or direction (Improvement Vision)
- Do: Grasp the current condition (Point A: Baseline)
- Check: Establish the next target condition (Desired Future State)
- Act: PDCA and experiments toward the target condition (Point B: Destination)
