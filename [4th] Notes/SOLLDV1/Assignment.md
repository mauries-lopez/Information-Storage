[Spotify Engineering Culture - Part 1 (aka the "Spotify Model") - YouTube](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYvfz4HGtoPc&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1748910801831900&usg=AOvVaw2BkuttCWXh4HlSjlSRXsei)

Cite three (3) Agile values and/or principles that were applied, and how.  

1. Be Collaborative

2. Spotify's engineering culture includes numerous autonomous squads that are responsible for creating features for Spotify. Decisions are made locally, avoiding the need to pass them through the higher-ups for approval. They further enrich this agile principle through their workspace setup because, per squad, they are gathered into a shared workspace for them to view each work easily and collaboratively. An example of this is when they hold retrospectives; there is a designated area for them to use for collaboration

3. Be adaptive

4. As what have mentioned in the video, the autonomous squads in Spotify are “loosely coupled but tightly aligned squads,” which pertains to how the collective groups work together towards a common goal but grow separately. They are continuing to experiment and adapt to the changes in their practices, especially in balancing between alignment and autonomy (this is the reason why they have autonomous squads). An example of this that was mentioned was the use of chapters and guilds in tribes.

5. Be communicative

6. The root of Spotify’s engineering culture is mutual respect. Employees are known to give credit to each other for great work and rarely take credit for themselves. Moreover, asking for help is highly encouraged, as they believe they are all in it together, working and communicating toward a common goal. An example of this is when they are aligning their goals; the leader’s job is to communicate what problems need to be solved, and the squad’s job is to communicate with each other on how to solve the problem.
