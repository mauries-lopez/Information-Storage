### **Innovation**
- It is not an invention. 
- Is the creation of better or more effective products, processes, services, or ideas technologies that are accepted by users desirability, and proposed at the right time according to governments and society viability.
- Innovation is about connecting, not inventing. It is about taking the pieces that are already out there and finding ways to put them together in combinations and bring them to people who have never seen them before.
- Network is the key
- Bring your asset to another market. <- Think small lang

*UVP, unique value proposition; “What makes you different from existing products”*

- A temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable solution to an existing problem.
- Driven by advanced network technology
- Is an innovative high-tech company
- Strong growth and scalability potential

### **Digital Startup Characteristics**

### **Entrepreneurship**
- Entreperneurship is the process of creating a sustainable business.
- There are two types of entrepreneurship:
	- Small and Medium Enterprises (SME)
	- Innovation-Driven Enterprise (IDE)

### **Entrepreneurship vs Management**

	- Entrepreneurship is cool, innovative, and exciting
	- Mangement is dull, serious, and bland
	- What is actually exciting is to see a startup succeed and change the world


### **Generating and Exploiting New Entries**
- New Entry
	- Offering a new product to an established or new market. (Example: Globe: dating telecommunication lang, ngayon offering internet service provider)
	- Offering an established product to a new market. (Example: Jollibee, nasa ibang bansa na nagoopen)
	- Creating a new organization.
- Entrepreneurial strategy
	- The set of decisions, actions, and reactions that first generate, and then exploit over time, a new entry.
- Generation of a New Entry Opportunity
	- Resources as a Source of Competitive Advantage
		- Resources are the building blocks to a firm’s functioning and performance; the inputs into the production process.
		- Resource must be:
			- Valuable
			- Rare
			- Inimitable (Not easily copied; Trade secret, algorithm)
	- Assessing the Attractiveness of a New Entry Opportunity
		- Depends on the level of information and the willingness to make a decision without perfect information.
	- Information on a New Entry
		- Prior knowledge and information search
			- More knowledge ensures a more efficient search process.
			- Search costs include time and money.
	- Comfort with Making a Decision under Uncerntainty
		- The trade-off between more information and the likelihood that the window of opportunity will close provides a dilemma for entrepreneurs.
			- Error of commission - negative outcome from acting on the perceived opportunity
			- Error of omission - Negative outcome from not acting on the new entry opportunity
*Window of opportunity is launching the innovation at the right time.*
- Entry Strategy for New Entry Exploitation
	- Being a first mover can result in a number of advantages that can enhance performance. These include:
		- Advantages:
			- Cost advantages
			- Less competitive rivalry
			- The opportunity to secure important supplier and distributor channels
			- A better position to satisfy customers
		- Disadvantages
			- Demand uncertainty - Difficulty in estimating the potential size of the market, how fast it will grow.
			- Technological uncertainty - Difficulty in assessing whether the technology will perform an whether alternate technology
			- Adaptation (Not sure kung disadvantage ito)
			- Uncertainty for customers - Difficulty in accurately assessing whether the new product or service provides value for them.
				- Overcome customer uncertainty by:
					- Informational advertising
					- Highlighting product benefits over substitutions.
					- Creating a frame of reference for potential customers.
					- Educating customers through demonstration and documentation.
			- Lead Time - The grace period in which the first mover operates in the industry under conditions of limited competition.
				- Lead time can be extended if the first mover can erect barriers to entry by:
					- Building customer loyalties (availability, consistencies)
					- Building switching costs. (loyalty cards; parang ano gagawin mo para mahirapan sila lumipat sa ibang product)
					- Protecting product uniqueness
					- Securing access to important sources of supply and distribution
- Risk Reduction Strategies for New Entry Exploitation
	- Risk is derived from uncertainties over market demand, technological development, and actions of competitors.
	- Two strategies can be used to reduce these uncertainties:
		- Market scope strategies - focus on which customer groups to serve and how to serve them.
		- Imitation strategies - involves copying the practices of others.
	- Market Scope Strategies
		- Narrow-scope strategy - offering a small product range to a small number of customer groups to satisfy a particular need.
			- Example: rolex, and rolls royce
		- Broad-scope strategy - offering a range of products across many different market segments.
			- Example: Toyota vs Rolss Royce
		- Imitation strategy
			- Why do it?
				- It is easier to imitate the practices of a successful firm
				- It can help develop skills necessary to be successful in the industry.
				- It provides organizational legitimacy.
			- Types of imitation strategies
				- Franchising - A franchise acquires the use of a “proven formula” for new entry from a franchisor.
				- “Me-too” strategy - Copying products that already exist and attempting to build an advantage through minor variations.

	- Occurs most frequently
- Defining a New Innovation: Newness can be a packaging
- Firm’s Viewpoint
	- Distinction can be made between new products and new markets

### **Mash-Up Ideation Method**
Ang idea rito ay dalawang concept tapos icocombine mo. Then use the features of each other to try innovate a new product.
1. Step 1 - Frame:
	- Articulate the challenge as a How Might We statement
2. Step 2 - Narrow:
	- Pick two broad, unrelated categories, like hospitals and hotels or waiting rooms and schools. Think outside your industry.
3. Step 3 - Generate
	- Starting with one category

- UVP
- Unfair Advantage

...
- Threat of New Entrants
- Bargaining Power of Buyers
- Threat of Substitute Products
- Bargaining Power of Suppliers

### **1st Theme - Who is Your Customer?**
1. Market Segmentation
	- Start by brainstorming possible customers
	- Be specific in characterizing your user, including his/her location, and other characteristics
	- **Go after a new market instead of trying to sell to everyone or snagging part of a huge market**
	- Narrow the list to top 6-12 markets
	- Finally, do research on those markets by talking to customers and observing them, making sure to be open to new information and not selling them on your solution.
2. Beachhead Market
	- Narrow the market to a smaller market (mas specific)
	- Once you have chosen a beach head market to pursue, you will have to do a good deal more sub-market segmentation to really get focus. This is what we call "peeling of the onion"
3. End User Profile![[Pasted image 20250528090113.png]]
4. Beachhead TAN size![[Pasted image 20250528090220.png]]
5. Persona
	- Why would that person buy what you want to sell?
	- What will your persona say to his or her friends about your product? Why?
	- Is Image a factor?
	- May photo, job salary (parang identify a real person)
	- Ang point nito kapag natamaan natin ung isang persona na loyal customer, may possibility na pwede niya ipag kalat ung product. 
	- if too specific ito, baka ung business mag overfit sa mga persona na ito.
