**Argument**
- A reason for taking something to be true.
- Consists of two or more claims, one of which is a conclusion, and the other claims are the premises.
- A good argument is an argument that has true premises that, when taken together, support its conclusion.
- Evaluating an argument, two essential steps:
	1. Determine whether or not the premises are true.
	2. Determine whether or not the premises support the conclusion.
- To know if something is an argument, one of which statement is proving another statement. For example, Fernanda doesn’t eat prok, beef, poultry, or fish. She must be a vegetarian. [(1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsXpZfWX1wQ)

Conclusion: the claim the argument purports to give a reason for believing.  
Premises: the premises of an argument, taken together, are offered as a reason for believing its conclusion.

We can assess the truth or falsity of the premises of an argument by examining evidence or by evaluating further arguments in support of the premises.

When we ask whether the premises support the conclusions, we are asking whether we’d have grounds for accepting the conclusion assuming the premises are true. To answer this question, we will want to apply one of two standards of support: deductive validity and inductive strength.

**Deductive Validity** [(1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Sg9zI-GNsI&t=349s
- To make the conclusion guaranteed. “Hindi siya unsure sa conclusion, confident siya na tama ung conclusion.”
- Two equivalent definitions of deductive validity:
	1. A valid argument is an argument where if its premises are true, then its conclusion must be true.
		“If all premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true”
	2. A valid argument is an argument where it is not possible for all of its premises to be true and its conclusion false.
		“There is no way for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true”
- In rules of inference, this is modus ponens and modus tollens.

**Inductive Validity** [(1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Sg9zI-GNsI&t=349s)
- To make the conclusion probable. “Hindi siya sure sa conclusion, hindi sigurado”
