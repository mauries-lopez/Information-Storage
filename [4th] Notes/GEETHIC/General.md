Ethics (“Moral Philosophy”)
- Example of Ethics:
	- “Does it matter who actually writes the term paper you turn in and represent as your own?”
- Philosophical study of morality.
- Morality: beliefs concerning right and wrong judgments, values, rules, principles, and theories.
	- Guides our actions, defines our values, and gives us reasons for being the persons we are.
- Ethics is concerned with values, specifically moral values. (What is worth living for and what is worth dying for)
- You are free not to think too deeply or too systematically about ethical concerns. You can simply embrace the moral beliefs and norms given to you by your family and your society.
- You can try not to do ethics, but it has some drawbacks.
	1. It undermines your personal freedom
		- If you accept and never question the moral beliefs handed to you by your culture, you are not in control. Your culture is in control of your decisions. BUT! If you critically examine these beliefs yourself and decide for yourself, only then will you be in charge of your own choices and actions.
	2. The no-questions-asked approach increases the chances that your responses to moral dilemmas or contradictions will be incomplete, confused, or mistaken.
		- Sometimes real-life situations are complicated, and hand-me-down morality isn’t enough to make the right decision. That’s why it’s important to also have the ability to think critically and evaluate moral beliefs for yourself.
	3.  If there is such a thing as intellectual moral growth, you are unlikely to find it on the safe route.
		-  Trying not to do ethics is like being stuck; no growth or learning is being made.
- Another easy road is to bypass critical and thoughtful scrutiny of morality.
	1. You let your emotions be your guide. “If it feels right, it is right.”
	2. Subjective relativism (you come to believe that moral realities are relative to each person) - You think that what a person believes or approves of determines the rightness or wrongness of actions.

//Ethics and Morality are sometimes used to refer to the moral norms of a specific group or individual (Greek Ethics, Russell’s Morality).

Philosopher Paul Taylor suggests that there is yet another risk in taking the easy road. “If someone blindly embraces the morality bequeathed to him by his society, he may very well be a fine embodiment of the rules of his culture and accept them with certainty. But he also will lack the ability to defend his beliefs by rational argument against criticism.”

### **Philosophy**
- Origin Greek (Greece) Words
	- Eptimological:
		- Philia: Love
		- Sophia: Wisdom 
		- = Love of Wisdom
- Verb: doing philosophy
- “Hows?” Wisdom
- Core of Philosophy is to ask questions
- We do philosophy if we question or examine our basic beliefs in life
	- Basic beliefs:
		- God exists: "Does God exists?"
		- Reality exists
		- Abortion is bad
			- Ectopic Pregnancy
				- The fetus grew in fallopian tube
				- Then a question is ask: 
					- if you do abortion, you will survive but fetus will not. 
					- if you dont do abortion, you will not survive and the fetus will also die
					//This is an <u>ETHICAL DILEMMA</u> 
- Philosophers are <u>lovers of wisdom</u> 
- Philosophers in Pilipino
	- Pilosopo
		1. Pilosopotacio - Positive sense of Pilosopher. These are the lovers of wisdom
		2. Kayo (kapag pinapagalitan) - Sophists : Negative sense of Philosopher. Ito ung mga taong love bullshiting. They trade their bullshit with love of money. (ex. Life Coach)

### **Landscape of Ethics**
- Ethics: a study of morality
- Different Senses of “Ethics”
	- Descriptive Ethics
		- The kind of ethics where the social scientists in general do.
		- This is the <u>scientific study of the moral beliefs and practices</u>
		- To explain
		- The questions we ask here are empirical questions
			- “How many states in America the allow child marriage legally?”
			- “How about in Asia, how many countries practice child marriage?”
			- “Is child marriage legal in America?”
	- Philosophical Ethics
		- Normative Ethics
			- The study of principles that guide our actions or judgment
			- Normative pertains to <u>norms or standards of judgement of rightness/goodness of the society</u>
			- Trying to establish the sound of moral norms
			- “Can we uphold child marriage daily?”
			- “Can we uphold wife beating daily?” because in Arab culture, it is considered wife beating is their a tradition. <u>Cultural Relativism</u> (parang dahil nasa culture nila, kaya okay lang?)
		- Metaethics
			- Study of meaning and the logical structure of moral beliefs.
			- Asks more fundamental questions about them: “What does it mean for the action to be right?”
			- <u>**What is “good”? What is “bad”?**</u>
			- This examines ethical claims about something.
			- In the video example:
				- Ethical claim: “I think child marriage is bad.” Then, using metaethics, we will take a step back and ask, “What makes an action bad?” Are we just alienated? What if we are related with the groom, do we consider child marriage good?
		- Applied Ethics
			- “Professional Ethics”
			- <u>The discussion of ethical problems in that particular profession.</u>
			- For example, law ethics, medical ethics
			- In the video example:
				- “Is it morally right for a YouTuber not to ask permission from his subjects?”
- Elements of Ethics
	- Critical Thinking
		- Preeminence of Reason
		- Doing ethics makes logical reasoning on top of the decision
		- Bertrand Russel
			- Its not just logical thinking but also the habitual practice of applying critical thinking + compassion.
	- The Universal Perspective
		- Universality of the standard of goodness and badness of things.
		- 
	- The Principle of Impartiality
		- No biases, No prejudices, Blank state
	- The Dominance of Moral Norms
- Why do ethics?
	- Ethics is inescapable; ethical dilemmas are ubiquitous.
	- The subject - the branch itself - helps you reflect about your life choices, the consequences of your actions or decisions, and your accountabilities.

### **My Basic Moral Position**
#### *Subjectivism, Relativism, and Emotivism*
- Honor Killing News
	- Honor Killing?
		- Murder committed by a killer (often their own parents, sisters, brothers, or husbands) who believe the victim must die to restore a so-called 'Honor'
		- Reasons?
			- Refused to arranged marriage
			- Elope with forbidden lover
			- Suspicion of adultery
			- Same sex relationship
			- Victims of rape
- Moral Compass
	- Tells us whenever we are in a crossroad of a moral dilemma (e.g. abortion, euthanasia) <u>where to go</u>.
- Objectivism
	- The view that some moral principles are valid for everyone.
	- The doctrine that some moral norms or principles are valid for everyone-universal, in other words.
- Cultural Relativism
	- The view that an action is morally right if one's culture approves of it.
- Subjective Relativism
	- The view that an action is morally right if one approves of it.
	- An action then can be right for you but wrong for someone else.
		- Your approving of an action makes it right
- Emotivism
	- The view that moral utterances are neither true nor false but are instead expressions of emotions or attitudes.
	- You believe that despite what your statement seems to mean, you are simply expressing your emotions.
	- You are not stating a fact; you are merely emoting and possibly trying to influence someone's behavior.

### House MD
- Dr. House said "Humanity is overrated"
	- Humans lie a lot. "If we dont talk to them, they cant lie to us and we cant lie to them"
	- They became doctors to treat illnesses not treating patients.
- "You cant always get what you want" by Jagger?
- "Truth begins in lies"

## **The Power of Moral Theories**
- Moral Theory
	- An explanation of what makes an action right or what makes a person or thing good.
	- Moral Theories concerned with the goodness of persons or things are known as **"Theories of Value"**
	- Moral Theories concerned with the rightness or wrongness of actions are called "**Theories of Obligation**"
- Consequentialist Theory
	- A theory asserting that what makes an action right is its consequences.
	- The rightness of an action depends on the amount of good it produces.
	- Several Consequentialist Theories
		- Utilitarianism
			- A theory asserting that the morally right action is the one that produces the most favorable balance of good over evil, everyone considered.
			- *The right thing to do is whatever brings the most happiness or good to the most people*
		- Act-Utilitarianism
			- A utilitarian theory asserting that the morally right action is the one that directly produces the most favorable balance of good over evil, everyone considered.
			- Rules are irrelevant to this calculation
			- *You should choose the action that, in that specific situation, brings the most happiness or good to the most people*
		- Rule-utilitarianism
			- A utilitarian theory asserting that the morally right action is the one covered by a rule that if generally followed would produce the most favorable balance of good over evil, everyone considered.
			- *You should follow rules that, if everyone followed them, would lead to the most oeverall good or happiness*
				- *Dont Lie*: *Even if lying in a certain situation might help someone, rule-utilitarianism says it’s better to stick to the rule, because if everyone lied whenever it felt useful, trust in society would break down — which causes more harm in the long run.*
		- Ethical Egoism
			- A theory asserting that the morally right action is the one that produces the most favorable balance of good over evil for oneself.
			- *You shoud look out for your own well-being first*
- Nonconsequentialist Theory
	- A theory asserting that the rightness of an action does not depend on its consequences.'
	- Primary concern is the **kind of action** in question.
	- Several Nonconsequentialist Theories
		- Categorical Imperative
			- An imperative that we should follow regardless of our particular wants and needs; also, the principle that defines Kant's ethical system.
			- *Only do something if you'd be okay with everyone else doing the same thing*
		- Kant's theory
			- A theory asserting that the morally right action is the one done in accordance with the categorical imperative.
			- *Doing the right thing means following moral rules*
			- *You should do the right thing just because it's the right thing not because it's easy, feels good, or helps you*
		- Natural Law Theory
			- A theory asserting that the morally right action is the one that follows the dictates of nature.
			- *The right thing to do is what agrees with human nature, what we were naturally meant to do. (e.g. preserving life, creating families, telling the truth, helping others)*
		- Divine Command Theory
			- A theory asserting that the morally right action is the one that God commands.
			- *The right thing to do is whatever God commands*
- Moral Criteria of Adequacy
	1. Consistency with considered judgements
	2. Consistency with our moral experiences
	3. Usefulness in moral problem solving
